# Your GitHub Learn Repository for GitHub Pages

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learn course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through, oh, I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learn bot and I'm here to guide you in your journey to learning and mastering the various topics covered in the GitHub Pages course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact I already added an issue for you to checkout.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
